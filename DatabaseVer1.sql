  <li><strong>Clear Articulation:</strong> Use simple language and avoid jargon unless necessary. Speak at a pace that is easy to follow.</li>
  <li><strong>Non-Verbal Communication:</strong> Body language, facial expressions, eye contact, and gestures all contribute to your message.</li>
  <li><strong>Empathy:</strong> Understand the emotions behind words and respond appropriately.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Tips to Improve Your Communication</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Practice Active Listening:</strong> Instead of planning what to say next, focus fully on the speaker.</li>
  <li><strong>Be Clear and Concise:</strong> Avoid unnecessary details. Structure your message with a beginning, middle, and end.</li>

  <li><strong>Observe Reactions:</strong> Adjust your message if the listener looks confused or disengaged.</li>
  <li><strong>Give and Receive Feedback:</strong> Use constructive criticism to improve your skills.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Common Barriers to Communication</h3>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Mastering communication skills takes time and conscious effort, but the benefits are immense — from stronger relationships to better career opportunities. Start with small daily practices, and you\ll see gradual improvement that transforms your interactions.</p>
